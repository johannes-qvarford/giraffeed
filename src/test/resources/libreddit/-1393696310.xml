I&amp;#39;m currently in the process of writing a movie to my book (sic), but it has been brought to my attention that somebody on tiktok (a very small creator at the moment) has been documenting their journey on making my book a movie because all of this makes perfect sense so far and someone with not skills or resources will definitely be able to make a movie to my book. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My question is: What happens if they finish before me? Since it&amp;#39;s my book, I assume I will have to approved and/or be alerted of this in someway, but I really have no idea how any film making and script writing things go? Obviously I am flattered somebody else wants to make my book a movie, but it&amp;#39;d like for my script to be used if and when there is a movie.

Not much of an update, but here‚Äôs more implausible shit that makes no sense I&amp;#39;m here to answer some questions. - I have emailed my agent. They are mostly going to reach out to this creator, explaining the legalities. I don&amp;#39;t want to burst this person&amp;#39;s bubble, but there&amp;#39;s many reason that I have to. - Unfortunately, I can&amp;#39;t just tell the tiktok that I&amp;#39;m in the process of writing a movie!! - I won&amp;#39;t take legal action until this creator does something illegal, like claim my work as theirs. - I cannot just work with this person in writing the movie for many reasons. For starters, I believe they are under 18. I am also quite far in this project and I&amp;#39;ve always got the whole thing planned out, so as much as I&amp;#39;d love to hear their ideas, it&amp;#39;s too late to add a writer. - This tiktok account, as I said, is veryyy small. I don&amp;#39;t believe they make any money off of these videos, I only found the account through a close friend, but I doubt any fans have even seen the account yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SECOND UPDATE: I will destroy this girl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/PorkloinMaster&quot;&gt; /u/PorkloinMaster &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/164b37v/somebody_else_it_writing_a_movie_to_my_book/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/164b37v/somebody_else_it_writing_a_movie_to_my_book/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_164b37v</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/164b37v/somebody_else_it_writing_a_movie_to_my_book/" /><updated>2023-08-29T06:59:51+00:00</updated><published>2023-08-29T06:59:51+00:00</published><title>Somebody else it writing a movie to my book</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Paramortal</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Paramortal</uri></author><category term="writingcirclejerk" label="r/writingcirclejerk"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey!&lt;br/&gt; So I&amp;#39;m a man, and while I feel like I have a decent grip on writing male on female PIV there&amp;#39;s just one thing I dont&amp;#39; feel like I can do at the moment: writing a third person POV scene from the girls&amp;#39;s perspective where she gets kicked in the groin (specifically the foot making contact, a cunt punt per se, if that makes a difference).

But is that not what being a writer is all about?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writers share another secret: We like to reward ourselves when we do great. And what defines greatness? To me, it emerges after crafting a new sentence or altering a comma. I am usually damned exhausted after that and need moral support. Again, the best gift for myself, the gift that makes me concentrate better, become a better boyfriend, and stronger too: alcohol. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was no way out of it. I decided last December to award myself with whisky (as in whisky stamped with an original Scottish ‚Äúy‚Äù). I love a good whisky, but I love two good whiskies better. As the count increases, my joy and writing improve vastly. At least that is the theory. Up until last December, it had merely been a theory, I have to admit that. But initially, all the crap above did sound promising.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;There Are Good Whiskies And Lovely Whiskies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It stopped being a theory by the end of 2022, though. My good friend Chris discovered that someone had made a whisky Advent calendar with samples of all the whisky genres you could imagine: good whisky, nice whisky, friendly whisky, enjoyable whisky, lovely whisky, and nice whisky‚Ä¶ or did I say that already? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For once, I had something to look forward to in December, aside from constipation and drunk dads sending rockets through my window on New Year‚Äôs Eve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the idea of an Advent calendar where you get a present each day for almost a month. A little reward for being such a patient and good boy. I was waiting excitedly for the shop to send me a new package each day (I guess I would get two on Saturdays because the mailman is too lazy to bring out packages on Sundays).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I was astonished when the first delivery arrived. The package was substantial, containing 24 small bottles. What a funny idea to have me taste different samples already on the first day of December. This was surely promising, but also quite a load of alcohol. I figured around 48 cl. In total (16.23 oz.). This promised to be quite a night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How I Destroyed My Computer While Untangling the Universe&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was late evening and my girlfriend had gone to sleep. I had put all of the sample bottles on the table and was getting ready to unleash the holy writer within me. It had been a rough year and finally, I would get a much-needed boost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the first whisky, I felt great. It carried a beautiful dark color, a walnut flavor, was sweet to the tongue, and warmed my body. I started writing and found myself feeling very concentrated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second one was just as good. It was a Glen Spey 17 with a honey flavor that made me forget all my worries. I actually finished the sentence I had started after the first whisky. Man, this was going well. I could get most of the paragraph done if this continued.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the next five, I kept getting more awesome. The Bruichladdich 20 even made me forget about writing for a while and just enjoy life. The sweet woody taste and the stronger 52.2 % made me realize that writing is not about writing at all. It is not about retreating to some fantasy kingdom either. It is about drinking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far so good, but let me tell you, the next seven were tougher. It became harder to read the labels on the bottles and I destroyed the keyboard on my laptop with a Hazelburn 8. I think it was a Hazelburn 8. But heck, the text on the screen was pure crap anyway. I suddenly realized that being a writer was not for me at all. Why did I keep lying to myself? Writing was just my attempt to escape that unfair planet that broke the catalytic converter on my Toyota Aygo. But if people wanted me to be unhappy, then FINE. Fuck them!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next four whiskies were a bit more positive. I regretted shouting at myself and waking up the neighbors. I even apologized to the old handicapped woman downstairs for trying to dig out the catalytic converter on her mobility scooter. Like I knew what a catalytic converter was anyway. Perhaps I was not a bad writer after all. I mean, we all have ups and downs. A text is not a static thing. I could change it. Make it better. I deleted everything I had written, all the hard work, the whole goddamn sentence, and started over. But there was a problem. I was not seeing very well anymore The letters were jumping around on the screen and half of the keys were not working because of the Hazelburn 8. It was actually quite funny. I started tap-dancing the letters and made a pretty melody. Soon I had written half a page and it was awesome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next three bottles were hazy. I did not care about the subtleties of tasting anymore. The whiskies were all the same. I realized through my daze that half the page I had written was pure nonsense. Like ‚ÄúFuck this‚Ä¶ bfjeid, fkdkk.‚Äù But I was feeling too bad to change it. I figured there would be an audience for that crap somewhere. I was a poet now. It took me 21 whiskies to realize my true objective. Who wants to write long texts? Only idiots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final three‚Ä¶. Well, I hardly remember them. I drank them in the bedroom while trying to explain the universe to my sleeping girlfriend. Wild stuff like: if Earth were a sand grain on a beach, then the entire universe would be like really, really many sand grains. Stuff like space being just like air, except that it is always black, whereas air is white during the day and black during the night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I passed out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Waking up to Chaos&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next day was demanding. I was hungover like hell. I puked all over my first draft and pooped on the sofa. There was a side-effect to being awesome. It had been a decent night, but man, there had been casualties. My laptop for instance. And half my book. It seemed that I had started deleting documents from Dropbox, too. The living room was full of broken glass and my girlfriend said she needed to go for a walk. ‚ÄúWITHOUT YOU, IDIOT,‚Äù she exclaimed, though I really needed fresh air.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The worst part was obvious. I knew this was going to be one heck of a December. This hangover was only after opening the first whisky door. Some calendar I had ordered. I waited anxiously for the second delivery. The December 2 package with another 24 small bottles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Sam_Guydude&quot;&gt; /u/Sam_Guydude &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/163g7fw/alcohol_a_writers_best_friend/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/163g7fw/alcohol_a_writers_best_friend/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_163g7fw</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/163g7fw/alcohol_a_writers_best_friend/" /><updated>2023-08-28T08:19:39+00:00</updated><published>2023-08-28T08:19:39+00:00</published><title>Alcohol ‚Äì A Writer‚Äôs Best Friend</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/the_tonez</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/the_tonez</uri></author><category term="writingcirclejerk" label="r/writingcirclejerk"/><content type="html">&amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/the_tonez&quot;&gt; /u/the_tonez &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/1630r2f/if_you_wrote_a_story_would_you_put_female/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/1630r2f/if_you_wrote_a_story_would_you_put_female/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1630r2f</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/1630r2f/if_you_wrote_a_story_would_you_put_female/" /><updated>2023-08-27T20:17:20+00:00</updated><published>2023-08-27T20:17:20+00:00</published><title>If you wrote a story, would you put female characters in it?</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/SeaworthinessFit2580</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/SeaworthinessFit2580</uri></author><category term="writingcirclejerk" label="r/writingcirclejerk"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My story has two supporting characters, Dick and Caulk, whose deeply real ‚Äî but platonic ‚Äî affection for each other is important for the story.

Part of my story hinges on my narrator Mary Sue realizing that Caulk will stay piously devoted to Dick even if Dick kills the Queen üëè they swore to serve, üíÖ meaning that Dick‚Äôs the only one who can lead his military coup and be charismatic, unique, nervous, and talented while doing it. It‚Äôs thus important for the story to convert they have an impenetrable bond as bosom friends. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I don‚Äôt want them to be romantically involved, and I don‚Äôt see them as a couple. But my writing group made comments about ‚Äúshipping‚Äù them, and one expressed disappointment when reading the 50-page hot hetero sex scene between Dick and Virginia because she assumed Dick and Caulk were already an item.
